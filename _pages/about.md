I am Ph.D. candidate in Applied Mathematics at the University of Arizona. My research interests concern ocean, climate, and earth system modeling, model validation, data assimilation, and numerical PDE. My current projects involve the effects of model resolution on regional ocean models of the Argentine Basin with biogeochemistry on air-sea fluxes of heat and carbon and on predictability of surface temperature and carbon concentration. This work is done under the supervision of Dr. Joellen Russell (UA) and Dr. Matt Mazloff (SIO).
