I am a model risk analyst at M&T Bank. I received a PhD in applied mathematics from the University of Arizona in 2021. My research interests concern ocean, climate, and earth system modeling, model validation, data assimilation, and numerical methods for partial differential equations, particularly geophysical fluid dynamics. My graduate research concerned the modeling of heat and carbon in the Argentine Basin and was done under the supervision of Joellen Russell (University of Arizona) and Matt Mazloff (Scripps Institution of Oceanography), and was funded by NSF under the [SOCCOM](https://soccom.princeton.edu/) project.
