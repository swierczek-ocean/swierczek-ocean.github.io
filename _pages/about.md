I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Naval Research Laboratory working on ocean data assimilation. I received a PhD in applied mathematics from the University of Arizona. My research interests concern ocean, climate, and earth system modeling, model validation, data assimilation, and numerical PDE. My graduate research concerned the modeling of heat and carbon in the Argentine Basin and was done under the supervision of Dr. Joellen Russell (UA) and Dr. Matt Mazloff (SIO), and was funded by NSF under the [SOCCOM](https://soccom.princeton.edu/) project.
