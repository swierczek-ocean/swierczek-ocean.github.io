The global oceans have absorbed about 93% of the excess energy in the earth system due to human activities (IPCC, 2014). Recent studies using the Argo array of autonomous profiling floats (Argo, 2000) estimate that as much as 99% of the global ocean heat gain in the 21<sup>st</sup> century has occurred in the southern hemisphere, primarily in the 30° - 50° band of the Southern Ocean (Wijffels
et al., 2016; Roemmich et al., 2015; Llovel & Terray, 2016). The Southern Ocean is also an important region for large exchanges of CO<sub>2</sub> between atmosphere and ocean. Strong anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake dominates substantial natural CO<sub>2</sub> outgassing from the upwelling of carbon-rich ancient waters (Gruber et al., 2009), and these observed features are supported by ocean and climate models. But the Southern Ocean is highly heterogeneous and there are subregions of interest that often have large uncertainties surrounding estimates of the physical and biogeochemical state. The Argentine Basin is one such region.

The Argentine Basin is a major bathymetric feature in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, bounded to the west by the Patagonian Shelf and to the south by the Malvinas Plateau. The collision of two major western boundary currents, the Brazil and Malvinas Currents, occurs in the western edge of the Basin and is the site of the highest mesoscale energy and sea surface height variability in the global oceans (Chelton et al., 1990; Fu et al., 2001).


The effect of resolution on vertical heat and carbon transports in a regional ocean circulation model of the Argentine Basin
======

Simulations of the Argentine Basin have large uncertainties associated with quantities such as air-sea exchanges of heat and carbon in current generation climate models and ocean reanalysis products. This is due to the complex topography, profound undersampling until recent years, and strong currents and mixing of subpolar and subtropical water masses in the basin. Because mixing of water masses is important here, model resolution is hypothesized to play an important role in estimating ocean quantities and determining overall budgets. We construct three regional ocean models with biogeochemistry at 1/3°, 1/6°, and 1/12° resolutions for the year 2017 to investigate heat and carbon dynamics in the region and determine the effect of model resolution on these dynamics. Initial conditions and boundary forcing from BSOSE (the Biogeochemical Southern Ocean State Estimate (Verdy & Mazloff, 2017)) and atmospheric forcing from ERA5 are used. The models are evaluated for accuracy by comparing output to Argo and BGC-Argo float profiles, BSOSE, and other reanalyses and mapped products. We then quantify the effect of resolution on model upper ocean heat and carbon transport and the associated air-sea exchanges. We determine that increasing the resolution from 1/3° to 1/12° enhances the upward vertical transport and surface exchanges of heat but causes no significant effect on surface carbon fluxes despite enhancing downward transport of anomalous DIC.

Investigating predictability of DIC and SST in the Argentine Basin through wind stress perturbation experiments
======

The confluence of the powerful Malvinas and Brazil currents over the Argentine Basin give the region chaotic dynamics and severely limit potential predictability. To probe the forecast horizon for ocean surface quantities like temperature and carbon, we construct regional models of the Argentine Basin with biogeochemistry at 1/3° and 1/12° resolution and design a series of experiments. We add positive and negative wind stress anomalies over small and large areas during a short period in different model runs. We calculate the linear and nonlinear responses of the surface temperature and dissolved inorganic carbon in the various scenarios and determine the minimum magnitude of these responses. The 1/3° model maintains predictability for up to 45 days, while the 1/12° model has a shorter window of about two weeks.
